## **Project Overview**

AlgoNexus is an automated financial trading system designed for backtesting and executing trading strategies using reinforcement learning (RL) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The system is built with a modular architecture, allowing easy integration of various trading strategies and environments. The current implementation focuses on a Moving Average Crossover Strategy using the Fetch.ai blockchain for decentralized trade execution.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Ubuntu 20.04 or higher (recommended)
- Git

### **Steps**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlgoNexus.git
   cd AlgoNexus
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Running the Trading Agent**
1. **Configure the Fetch.ai Ledger Connection:**
   - Set up your private key and connect to the Fetch.ai testnet or mainnet.

2. **Run the Agent:**
   ```bash
   python src/agent_management.py
   ```

3. **Backtest the Strategy:**
   ```bash
   python src/moving_average_crossover_strategy.py
   ```

4. **Monitor the Output:**
   - Check the console for real-time updates on trading decisions and executed trades.
   - View the generated plots for performance analysis.

## **Components**

### **Trading Environment**
The `TradingEnvironment` class in `trading_environment.py` is a custom OpenAI Gym environment. It simulates a trading environment using historical price data and allows the agent to interact with it by buying, selling, or holding assets.

**Key Features:**
- **Reset:** Initializes the environment for a new episode.
- **Step:** Executes one time step within the environment based on the agent’s action.
- **Render:** Outputs the current state of the environment for visualization.

### **Trading Agent**
The `TradingAgent` class in `agent_management.py` is the main component that interacts with the trading environment. It uses the Moving Average Crossover Strategy to make buy, sell, or hold decisions and executes trades on the Fetch.ai ledger.

**Key Features:**
- **make_decision:** Determines the action to take based on the strategy's signal.
- **execute_trade:** Executes the trade on the Fetch.ai blockchain.
- **run:** Runs the agent through multiple episodes for backtesting and evaluation.

### **Moving Average Crossover Strategy**
The `crossover_strategy` function in `moving_average_crossover_strategy.py` implements the trading logic based on short-term and long-term moving averages. When the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, the strategy signals a buy. Conversely, when it crosses below, it signals a sell.

**Key Features:**
- **moving_average:** Calculates the moving average for a given window size.
- **crossover_strategy:** Generates buy/sell signals based on moving averages.
- **backtest_strategy:** Simulates the strategy over historical data to evaluate performance.

## **Testing and CI/CD**

### **Linting and Testing**
The project uses `flake8` for linting and `pytest` for testing. These are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

**Run Locally:**
```bash
# Run Linting
flake8 src/

# Run Tests
pytest
```

### **Continuous Integration**
The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file defines the CI/CD pipeline. It runs on each push or pull request to the `main` branch. The pipeline includes steps for:
- Checking out the code
- Setting up the Python environment
- Installing dependencies
- Running linting and tests

## **Contributing**

We welcome contributions from the community. Please follow the steps below:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and ensure all tests pass.
3. Open a pull request describing your changes.
